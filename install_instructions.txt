Install instructions

(Android Studio is now the official IDE, but I haven't used it before so I am just going to use eclipse for now)

If you want to just install the application, go to cse481L/testApp/TestApp/bin and copy TestApp.apk to the phone.
You can then use a file manager to install the app.


1. Install SDK
http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html?pkg=tools

2. Install the eclipse plugin
http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/installing-adt.html

3. Open eclipse, choose a workspace (not the same as cse481L/testApp, causes an error).

4. File,Import, Android, Existing Android Code into Workspace

5. plug in phone

6. Run, run as android application

7. Make sure your phone and computer are on the same wifi

8. Start a server on port 9000 (you can start the python server I put in)

9. Input the computer ip and press start - the phone should connect to the server



MainActivity.java (in testApp/TestApp/src/com/example/testapp) class is the main code of the application.

activity_main.xml (in testApp/TestApp/res/layout) is what the screen on the application looks like
